[["index.html", "S1Y Lab 3 1 Welcome to S1Y Lab 3", " S1Y Lab 3 1 Welcome to S1Y Lab 3 This is the Forensic Case Study Lab. As you work through the different sections, you will be asked some multiple-choice questions, run example code and also write your own code. After you finish the sections Value of Evidence Example and PCR testing (COVID-19), you are asked to complete a Group Exercise. In this tutorial, you will: compute posterior probabilities of the form \\(P(H_{p}|E)\\) from prior probabilities \\(P(H_{p})\\), using odds and the value of evidence. write a function that computes a conditional probability using Bayes' theorem. investigate the effects of sensitivity, specificity and base rate on test results. Before you start your work in RStudio, make sure you have the following packages installed and loaded: #you only need to install them once install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) #load them at the start of each session library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) "],["value-of-evidence-example.html", "2 Value of Evidence Example", " 2 Value of Evidence Example Reconsider the following example from Case Study lecture 2: A domestic burglary had been committed in New Zealand. It was thought that the perpetrator had cut themselves on a piece of glass, which was found at the crime scene. The blood was of type O (in the ABO system). We shall assume there is no explanation for the presence of the blood on the glass other than it got there when broken by the offender (that is, we assume a link between blood and offender). We consider the following hypotheses: \\(H_{p}\\): The suspect is the source of the blood. \\(H_{d}\\): Someone other than the suspect is the source of the blood. Here are the frequencies of blood groups on the ABO system in New Zealand at the time of the burglary: What is the value of evidence (V) in this example? (To 3 decimal places). Hint 1 E is the evidence of blood of type O found on the piece of glass. Remember that \\(V=\\frac{P(E|H_{p})}{P(E|H_{d})}\\). Hint 2 In this example, \\(P(E|H_{p})\\) is the probability of finding blood of type O on the piece of glass if the suspect was the source of the blood. Similarly, \\(P(E|H_{d})\\) is the probability of finding blood of type O on the piece of glass if someone other than the suspect was the source. Solution \\(P(E|Hp)=1\\), as we know the suspect has blood group O. \\(P(E|Hd)=0.683\\), as the prevalence of blood group O is 68.3%. Hence, \\(V=\\frac{P(E|Hp)}{P(E|Hd)}=\\frac{1}{0.683}=1.464\\). Remember the following relation: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Odds}(H_{p}|E)=V \\times \\text{Odds}(H_{p}) \\end{align*}\\] Assume that, before considering the blood group as piece of evidence, the prior probability of the suspect being the source of the blood is \\(P(H_{p})=0.2\\). What are the prior odds in favour of Hp? (To 2 decimal places). Hint 1 The prior odds in favour of \\(H_{p}\\) can be computed as $(H_{p})=. Hint 2 Here, \\(H_{p}\\) and \\(H_{d}\\) are complementary hypotheses. Hence, \\(P(H_{d})=1-P(H_{p})\\). Solution \\(Odds(Hp)=\\frac{P(Hp)}{(1-P(Hp))}= \\frac{0.2}{0.8} = 0.25\\). What are the posterior odds in favour of Hp, for the value of evidence and prior odds you have just computed? (To 3 decimal places). Hint The posterior odds can be computed as \\(Odds(Hp|E)= V \\times Odds(Hp)\\). Solution \\(Odds(Hp|E)= V \\times Odds(Hp) = 1.464 \\times 0.25=0.366\\) Remember the following relation: \\[\\begin{align*} P(H_{p}|E)=\\frac{\\text{Odds}(H_{p}|E)}{\\text{Odds}(H_{p}|E)+1} \\end{align*}\\] Now, plot the posterior probability of \\(H_{p}\\), given the evidence, against the prior probability for each \\(P(H_{p})\\) in {0.01,0.02,0.03,...,0.99}. You can create an object which contains a sequence of values using the seq() function, e.g. seq(from=0.01,to=0.99,by=0.01). You can create a \"quick\" plot using plot(x=...,y=...,type=...), where x and y are two vectors of the same length and type can take values like \"p\" for points and \"l\" for line (note that the letters must appear in quotes). If you want to create the plot using ggplot, you will have to add the two vectors to a dataframe first. Once you have created the objects prior_prob and posterior_prob, this can be done using the following code: probs &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(prior_prob,posterior_prob)) ggplot(data=probs,aes(prior_prob,posterior_prob)) + geom_line() Hint 1 prior_prob &lt;- seq(from=0.01,to=0.99,by=0.01) prior_odds &lt;- prior_prob/(1-prior_prob) Hint 2 prior_prob &lt;- seq(from=0.01,to=0.99,by=0.01) prior_odds &lt;- prior_prob/(1-prior_prob) V &lt;- 1.464 posterior_odds &lt;- V*prior_odds posterior_prob &lt;- posterior_odds/(posterior_odds+1) Solution prior_prob &lt;- seq(from=0.01,to=0.99,by=0.01) prior_odds &lt;- prior_prob/(1-prior_prob) V &lt;- 1.464 posterior_odds &lt;- V*prior_odds posterior_prob &lt;- posterior_odds/(posterior_odds+1) plot(x=prior_prob,y=posterior_prob,type=&#39;l&#39;) Since we want to compare the posterior probability with the prior probability (both being between 0 and 1), it would be better for them to be on the same scale. Here is an option for how to get them to be on the same scale and adding a reference line to display the case where the prior and posterior probabilities are the same, in ggplot: library(ggplot2) prior_prob &lt;- seq(from=0.01,to=0.99,by=0.01) prior_odds &lt;- prior_prob/(1-prior_prob) V &lt;- 1.464 posterior_odds &lt;- V*prior_odds posterior_prob &lt;- posterior_odds/(posterior_odds+1) prior_post_data &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(prior_prob,posterior_prob)) ggplot(prior_post_data, aes(x = prior_prob, y = posterior_prob)) + geom_line() + #defining scale_x_continuous and scale_y_continuous in the same way causes the scales for prior and posterior probabilities to be the same scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + geom_abline(intercept=0,slope=1,col=&quot;red&quot;,linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Prior Probability&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) What is the posterior probability of Hp, given the evidence, corresponding to a prior probability of \\(P(H_p) = 0.6\\)? (As a percentage, to 2 decimal places) Hint 1 First, compute \\(\\text{Odds}(H_{p}|E)=V \\times \\text{Odds}(H_{p})\\). Hint 2 Then, you can compute \\(P(H_{p}|E)=\\frac{\\text{Odds}(H_{p}|E)}{\\left(\\text{Odds}(H_{p}|E)+1\\right)}\\). Solution \\(Odds(Hp|E)=V \\times Odds(Hp)=1.464 \\times \\frac{0.6}{0.4}=2.196\\) \\(P(Hp|E)=\\frac{Odds(Hp|E)}{(Odds(Hp|E)+1)}=\\frac{2.196}{3.196}= 0.6871\\) "],["pcr-testing-covid-19.html", "3 PCR testing (COVID-19) 3.1 P(Infection|Positive Test) 3.2 Exploration of sensitivity/specificity 3.3 P(No Infection|Negative test) 3.4 Exploration of sensitivity/specificity", " 3 PCR testing (COVID-19) PCR stands for a laboratory technique known as polymerase chain reaction (you might remember this from the DNA video). In the PCR test, the goal is to selectively amplify trace amounts of genetic material, identifying specific parts of DNA. PCR only works on DNA, and the COVID-19 virus uses RNA as its genetic code. RNA is similar to DNA, but only has a single strand. Fortunately, viral enzymes to convert RNA into DNA were discovered decades ago, to find unique signatures in RNA, too. Once a patient arrives at a safe testing site, a sample is taken by the health care team. Usually that means a narrow swab is placed in a person's nose or mouth to collect cells from the back of the throat. The sample is then analysed in a laboratory and the patient gets the result of the test after 1-3 days. If you want to learn more, you can find this description and further explanation at https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2020/03/27/the-science-behind-the-test-for-the-covid-19-virus/ Here is a summary of the performance of PCR tests: they give a negative result in 99.9% of the cases when the patient does not have COVID-19, i.e. the proportion of false positives is 0.1%; they give a positive result in 98% of the cases when the patient has a COVID-19 infection, i.e. the proportion of false negatives is 2%. What are sensitivity, specificity, and base rate of the PCR test? sensitivity: 99.9%, specificity: 2%, base rate: 1.9% sensitivity: 98%, specificity: 99.9%, base rate: not provided sensitivity: 99.9%, specificity: 98%, base rate: not provided sensitivity: 0.1%, specificity: 99.9%, base rate: 1.9% 3.1 P(Infection|Positive Test) Let us now assume a prevalence of COVID-19 of 1% in the public. If the PCR test gives a positive result for a randomly selected patient, what is the conditional probability that they have a COVID-19 infection? (To 2 decimal places). Hint Let Inf denote infection, T+ denote a positive test. Then, use Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability: \\(P(Inf|T+)=\\frac{P(T+|Inf) \\times P(Inf)}{P(T+|Inf) \\times P(Inf)+P(T+|no Inf) \\times P(no Inf)}\\) Solution Let Inf denote infection, T+ denote a positive test. Then, use Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability: \\(P(Inf|T+)=\\frac{P(T+|Inf) \\times P(Inf)}{P(T+|Inf) \\times P(Inf)+P(T+|no Inf) \\times P(no Inf)}=\\frac{0.98 \\times 0.01}{0.98 \\times 0.01 + 0.001 \\times 0.99}\\approx 0.91\\) Now, how does the answer depend on the sensitivity and specificity? Which of the two characteristics is more crucial for the conditional probability (of infection, given a positive test) to become satisfactorily high? Here we will use R to explore what happens when we vary the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Set the values for the sensitivity and specificity as provided in the description and assume a base rate (prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the public) of 1%: sens &lt;- 0.98 spec &lt;- 0.999 brate &lt;- 0.01 Let \\(C\\) denote the event of a COVID-19 infection. Thus, \\(C^{c}\\) is the event of no COVID-19 infection. Let \\(T+\\) denote the event of a positive test result. The probability of an infection, given the test comes out positive can be calculated using Bayes theorem as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} P(C|T+)=\\frac{P(T+|C)\\times P(C)}{P(T+|C)\\times P(C) + P(T+|C^{c}) \\times P(C^{c})} \\end{align*}\\] Note: \\[\\begin{align*} P(T+|C)\\times P(C)&amp;=\\text{sensitivity} \\times \\text{base rate}\\\\ P(T+|C^{c})\\times P(C^{c})&amp;=(1-\\text{specificity}) \\times (1-\\text{base rate}) \\end{align*}\\] Thus, we get the following: \\[\\begin{align*} P(C|T+)=\\frac{\\text{sensitivity} \\times \\text{base rate}}{\\text{sensitivity} \\times \\text{base rate} + (1-\\text{specificity}) \\times (1-\\text{base rate})} \\end{align*}\\] Check that the formula above gives the right answer for the COVID-19 example we looked at in the last question above. The result we computed manually was approximately 0.91. 3.2 Exploration of sensitivity/specificity We want to explore the effects of sensitivity, specificity and base rate on the posterior probability of a patient having a COVID-19 infection, given that the test is positive. First, lets vary the sensitivity, keeping the specificity at 0.999 and the base rate at 0.01. Plot the probabilities of a COVID-19 infection, given a positive test result for sensitivity levels 0.70,0.71,0.72,...,0.99,1.00 Hint sens &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) spec &lt;- 0.999 brate &lt;- 0.01 prob &lt;- sens*brate/(sens*brate + (1-spec)*(1-brate)) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(sens,prob)) Solution ggplot(df, aes(x = sens, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Sensitivity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) What would be the probability of a COVID-19 infection, given a positive test, if the test had a sensitivity of 100%? (As a percentage, to two decimal places). Hint Compute \\(\\frac{sens*brate}{sens*brate + (1-spec)*(1-brate)}\\). Solution Compute \\(\\frac{sens*brate}{sens*brate + (1-spec)*(1-brate)}\\) for \\(sens=1,spec=0.999,brate=0.01\\). Motivating question: Given a positive test result, why is the probability of a COVID-19 infection not 100%, if we have a sensitivity of 100%? That, we will explore next. Let's see how the specificity might effect that probability of infection given a positive test. That is, vary the specificity, keeping the sensitivity now fixed at 0.98 and the base rate at 0.01. Plot the probabilities of a COVID-19 infection, given a positive test result for specificity levels 0.7,0.71,0.72,...,0.99,1.00 Hint sens &lt;- 0.98 spec &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) brate &lt;- 0.01 prob &lt;- sens*brate/(sens*brate + (1-spec)*(1-brate)) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(spec,prob)) Solution ggplot(df, aes(x = spec, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Specificity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) Compare the two graphs you plotted above. Which characteristic of the test seems to have a greater effect on the probability of infection, given a positive test result? Specificity Sensitivity They have about the same effect Now, let's retry that for a different base rate. Consider an apartment complex where COVID-19 has been able to spread drastically. Assume a prevalence of 50% for the people living in the building. That is, every person in the building is just as likely to have a COVID-19 infection, as they are not to have a COVID-19 infection. Then, how do sensitivity and specificity affect the probability of infection, given a positive test? The code is quite similar, so just look at the results that are given here: For different values of sensitivity: brate &lt;- 0.5 sens &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) spec &lt;- 0.999 prob &lt;- sens*brate/(sens*brate + (1-spec)*(1-brate)) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(sens,prob)) ggplot(df, aes(x = sens, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Sensitivity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) For diffent values of specificity: brate &lt;- 0.5 sens &lt;- 0.98 spec &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) prob &lt;- sens*brate/(sens*brate + (1-spec)*(1-brate)) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(spec,prob)) ggplot(df, aes(x = spec, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Specificity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) For the new base rate of 50%, is there a difference in how sensitivity and specificity affect the probability of infection, given a positive test? Specificity still has a stronger effect than sensitivity, although the difference is less drastic than when we had a prevalence of 1% Specificity still has a stronger effect than sensitivity, with a similar difference as in the case of prevalence of 1% Sensitivity and specificity now have a similar effect on the probability of infection, given a positive test 3.3 P(No Infection|Negative test) Now, how do these effects change if we consider the probability of no COVID-19 infection, given a negative PCR test? Here is again the summary of the PCR test: They give a negative result in 99.9% of the cases when the patient does not have COVID-19, i.e. the proportion of false positives is 0.1%; They give a positive result in 98% of the cases when the patient does have a COVID-19 infection, i.e. the proportion of false negatives is 2%. Let us again assume a prevalence of COVID-19 of 1% in the public. If the PCR test gives a negative result for a randomly selected patient, what is the conditional probability that they do not have a COVID-19 infection? (As a percentage, to two decimal places). Hint Let Inf denote infection, T- denote a negative test. Then, use Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability: \\(P(No Inf|T-)=\\frac{P(T-|No Inf) \\times P(No Inf)}{P(T-|No Inf) \\times P(No Inf) + P(T-|Inf) \\times P(Inf)}\\) Solution Let Inf denote infection, T- denote a negative test. Then, use Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability: \\(P(No Inf|T-)=\\frac{P(T-|No Inf) \\times P(No Inf)}{P(T-|No Inf) \\times P(No Inf) + P(T-|Inf) \\times P(Inf)}= \\frac{0.999 \\times 0.99}{0.999 \\times 0.99 + 0.02 \\times 0.01}=0.9998\\) Again, let us explore how the answer depends on sensitivity and specificity. Which of the two characteristics is more crucial for the conditional probability (of no infection, given a negative test) to become satisfactorily high? First, let us reset the characteristics to their original levels: sens &lt;- 0.98 spec &lt;- 0.999 brate &lt;- 0.01 Now, let \\(C\\) again denote the event of a COVID-19 infection (note that \\(C^{c}\\) hence means no infection). Let \\(T-\\) denote the event of a negative test result. The probability of no infection, given the test comes out negative can be calculated using Bayes theorem as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} P(C^{c}|T-)=\\frac{P(T-|C^{c})\\times P(C^{c})}{P(T-|C^{c})\\times P(C^{c}) + P(T-|C) \\times P(C)} \\end{align*}\\] Note: \\[\\begin{align*} P(T-|C^{c})\\times P(C^{c})&amp;=\\text{specificity} \\times (1-\\text{base rate})\\\\ P(T-|C)\\times P(C)&amp;=(1-\\text{sensitivity}) \\times \\text{base rate} \\end{align*}\\] Thus, we get the following: \\[\\begin{align*} P(C^{c}|T-)=\\frac{\\text{specificity} \\times (1-\\text{base rate})}{\\text{specificity} \\times (1-\\text{base rate}) + (1-\\text{sensitivity}) \\times \\text{base rate}} \\end{align*}\\] Check that the formula above gives the right answer for the COVID-19 example. The result we computed manually was approximately 99.98%. Hint 1 sens &lt;- 0.98 spec &lt;- 0.999 brate &lt;- 0.01 Solution spec*(1-brate)/(spec*(1-brate) + (1-sens)*brate) 3.4 Exploration of sensitivity/specificity Lets vary the sensitivity for this setup, keeping the specificity at 0.999 and the base rate at 0.01. Plot the probabilities of no COVID-19 infection, given a negative test result for sensitivity levels 0.70,0.71,0.72,...,0.99,1.00 Hint 1 sens &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) spec &lt;- 0.999 brate &lt;- 0.01 prob &lt;- spec*(1-brate)/(spec*(1-brate) + (1-sens)*brate) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(sens,prob)) Solution ggplot(data=df, aes(x = sens, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Sensitivity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) Let's see how the specificity might effect that probability of no infection given a negative test. That is, vary the specificity, keeping the sensitivity now fixed at 0.98 and the base rate at 0.01. Plot the probabilities of a COVID-19 infection, given a positive test result for specificity levels 0.7,0.71,0.72,...,0.99,1.00 Hint 1 sens &lt;- 0.98 spec &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) brate &lt;- 0.01 prob &lt;- spec*(1-brate)/(spec*(1-brate) + (1-sens)*brate) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(spec,prob)) Solution ggplot(data=df, aes(x = spec, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Specificity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) Compare the two graphs you plotted above. Which characteristic of the test seems to have a greater effect on the probability of no infection, given a negative test result? Sensitivity They have about the same effect. Specificity Let's retry that again for a different base rate. Re-consider the apartment complex where COVID-19 has been able to spread drastically. We assume a prevalence of 50% for the people living in the building. That is, every person in the building is just as likely to have a COVID-19 infection, as they are not to have a COVID-19 infection. Then, how do sensitivity and specificity affect the probability of no infection, given a negative test? Just look at the results that are given here: Alternating sensitivity: brate &lt;- 0.5 sens &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) spec &lt;- 0.999 prob &lt;- spec*(1-brate)/(spec*(1-brate) + (1-sens)*brate) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(sens,prob)) ggplot(data=df, aes(x = sens, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Sensitivity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;)#fill in this function Alternating specificity: brate &lt;- 0.5 sens &lt;- 0.98 spec &lt;- seq(from=0.7,to=1,by=0.01) prob &lt;- spec*(1-brate)/(spec*(1-brate) + (1-sens)*brate) df &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(spec,prob)) ggplot(data=df, aes(x = spec, y = prob)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Specificity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Posterior Probability&quot;) Compare the two graphs you plotted above. Which characteristic of the test seems to have a greater effect on the probability of no infection, given a negative test result? Specificity Sensitivity They have about the same effect. "],["group-exercise.html", "4 Group Exercise 4.1 Sample size needed to obtain certain probabilities for observing rare events 4.2 Differently coloured eyes 4.3 A criminal with differently coloured eyes", " 4 Group Exercise 4.1 Sample size needed to obtain certain probabilities for observing rare events (This was briefly discussed in lecture 3) Assume we are interested in an event that is observed with probability \\(\\lambda\\). Remember that the probability of observing at least one such event in a sample of size \\(n\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} 1-(1-\\lambda)^{n} \\end{align*}\\] 4.2 Differently coloured eyes Having two different eye colours is known as heterochromia iridis. It is approximated that 6 in 1000 people have such a condition (i.e., \\(\\lambda=6/1000\\)), although for most of these cases, it is hardly noticeable and unassociated with any other abnormality. 1. If you were to randomly sample 500 people, what would be the probability of seeing at least one person with two different coloured eyes? (As a percentage, to two decimal places) % 2. Now, create a plot that shows the probability of seeing at least one person with eyes of different colours, by sample size. 3. If we were planning to find a person with differently coloured eyes, one could argue that sampling 800 people might not be enough to have a good chance of finding such a person. How would you respond to a suggestion that 1500 people should be sampled instead? The probability of finding such person in a sample of 800 people seems sufficiently high. The additional expenses to sample another 700 people are probably not worth it. We can't be too confident in finding such a person in a sample of 800 people, so it would seem worth the additional effort and expenses to sample another 700 people. 4. Let's assume you were to take a different approach and randomly sample people until you would find one with differently coloured eyes. How many people do you expect you would have to sample until you would find such a person? (As a whole number) Now, let \\(p\\) be the probability we would like to achieve of observing at least one person with differently coloured eyes. Then, we can compute the sample size \\(n\\) that is needed to obtain that probability \\(p\\) of observing at least one such person: \\[\\begin{align*} p \\leq 1-(1-\\lambda)^{n} &amp;\\Rightarrow (1-\\lambda)^{n} \\leq 1-p\\\\ &amp;\\Rightarrow n \\times log(1-\\lambda) \\leq log(1-p)\\\\ &amp;\\Rightarrow n \\geq \\frac{log(1-p)}{log(1-\\lambda)} \\hspace{2em} [\\frac{1}{log(1-\\lambda)}&lt;0 \\text{ for } 0&lt;\\lambda&lt;1] \\end{align*}\\] 5.

What sample size would be needed, so that we are just as likely to see a person with different coloured eyes in the sample, as that we would not see such a person? (As a whole number) 4.3 A criminal with differently coloured eyes In Scotland, a bank was robbed and the employee who handed over the money said the criminal had eyes of different colours. Later that day, an individual had been stopped by the police, as they recognised her car from a list of stolen vehicles. The officer who wrote the report about the car-incidence noted in the description of the driver that she had eyes of different colours. When the bank robbery was reported on the news, the officer noticed a possible connection between the driver and the criminal who robbed the bank, as they both had eyes of different colours. Hence, the following hypotheses are considered: \\(H_{p}\\): The driver is the person that robbed the bank. \\(H_{d}\\): Someone other than the driver robbed the bank. 7. What is the value of evidence in support of Hp, the evidence being eyes of different colours? (To 2 decimal places) Now, the bank employee said the robber was approximately 175cm tall, which also fits the description of the driver who was stopped by the police, as she has a height of 176cm. To allow for some uncertainty, we assume that any person between 172cm and 178cm could have committed the robbery. In Scotland, the average height of a woman is 163cm. Let us assume a standard deviation of 6cm for height of women. Then, it seems reasonable to assume the height of women in Scotland to be normally distributed with mean 163cm and standard deviation of 6cm. 8. Under the assumption of a normal distribution with mean 163cm and standard deviation of 6cm, what is the probability of a randomly selected woman in Scotland to be between 172cm and 178cm tall? (As a whole number percentage) % We should be safe to assume that the evidence of height (\\(E_{1}\\)) and that of different coloured eyes (\\(E_{2}\\)) are independent. 9. What is the value of evidence in support of Hd, given the evidence that the driver is between 172m and 178m tall and that she has eyes of different colours? (As a whole number) "]]
